# Fuzzing with libfuzzer

For the possibly more up-to-date guide see <https://fuzz.rs/book/cargo-fuzz/setup.html>.

> $ cargo install cargo-fuzz
> $ cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzzer_script_<format>

Fuzzing may progress faster for certain formats if seeded with a dictionary:

> $ cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzzer_script_xbm -- -dict=fuzz/dictionaries/xbm.dict

# Bug reports

As explained in the project [README](../README.md), fuzzing is not a priority for
this crate and decoders may panic or worse on malformed input. Please do not
open issues for crashes found by fuzzing, though PRs fixing them are welcome.
